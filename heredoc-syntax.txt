Heredoc syntax in shell scripting is used to pass a multiline string to a command or create files with multiple lines of content. It's particularly useful when dealing with large chunks of text. The syntax for a heredoc looks like this:

command <<DELIMITER
your text or code block
DELIMITER

The DELIMITER can be any string, and << indicates the start of the heredoc. The text or code block continues until the closing DELIMITER is found on a line by itsel

cat <<EOF
This is an example
of heredoc in shell scripting.
EOF

or
=====
cat <<MYDELIMITER
This is some text.
MYDELIMITER

In general, EOF is used because it's easily understandable and less likely to clash with the content inside the heredoc.
